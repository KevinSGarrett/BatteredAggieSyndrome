# AI Work Packet — POST-EPIC-007

## Packet mode

`AGGREGATE_GATE`

**DO NOT execute this Epic/Story as an atomic implementation task.** This is an aggregate integration, evidence-review, and closure-gate packet. Implementation mutations belong to READY atomic Subtask packets.

## What capability or closure gate am I coordinating?

Materialize higher-resolution football state required for credible availability-aware forecasts and A&M specialization while preserving uncertainty and source limits.

## Why?

The final W25 handoff identifies this capability as necessary to move from accepted design/functional starters to evidence-backed implementation, empirical validation, production readiness, or operation.

## Aggregate integration and closure scope

All Stories and Subtasks under this Epic for the advanced-football domain, including its explicit integrated completion gate.

### In scope

- Child implementation and evidence work
- Cross-domain hard dependencies
- Integrated end-to-end gate
- Preservation of source authority and protected controls

### Out of scope

- Declaring child code sufficient without integrated evidence
- Changing protected requirements or ADRs without governance review
- Creating Wave 26

## Current gate state

- Workflow: `BACKLOG`
- Ready: `false`
- Priority: `P1`
- Critical path: `true`
- Execution lane: `PROTECTED_GATE`
- Execution mode: `AGGREGATE_GATE`
- Maturity before → after: `FUNCTIONAL_STARTER` → `EMPIRICALLY_VALIDATED`
- Evidence state: `PLANNED`
- Governance traceability gate: `POST-SUBTASK-069`

## Exact outputs / integrated artifacts

Review and integrate these child-produced outputs; do not recreate them directly from this aggregate packet:

- artifacts/player_intelligence/player_state_manifest.json
- artifacts/player_intelligence/player_value_availability_report.json
- artifacts/player_intelligence/player_intelligence_gate.json
- artifacts/player_intelligence/program_event_manifest.json
- artifacts/context_intelligence/program_feature_manifest.json
- artifacts/context_intelligence/program_intelligence_gate.json
- artifacts/context_intelligence/game_context_state_manifest.json
- artifacts/context_intelligence/mechanics_sparse_opponent_manifest.json
- artifacts/context_intelligence/context_gate.json

## Acceptance criteria

1. Every child issue completes at its declared maturity and evidence state, or has an explicit accepted-risk/deferred disposition.
2. The Epic's end-to-end gate proves the integrated capability on the required real data, target host, protected chronology, or operating path; file existence alone is insufficient.
3. All requirement, acceptance-control, ADR, risk, gap, test, artifact, and source references remain valid and no protected invariant is weakened.

## Tests / validation

- END_TO_END / END_TO_END: POST-SUBTASK-063 — Story gate `POST-SUBTASK-063` must complete with verified evidence before Epic completion.
- END_TO_END / END_TO_END: POST-SUBTASK-066 — Story gate `POST-SUBTASK-066` must complete with verified evidence before Epic completion.
- END_TO_END / END_TO_END: POST-SUBTASK-069 — Story gate `POST-SUBTASK-069` must complete with verified evidence before Epic completion.
- REPRODUCIBILITY / REPRODUCIBILITY: EPIC_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST — Aggregate all Story gates, artifact identities, residual blockers, accepted risks, and downstream readiness.

## Evidence to return

- Verified Story gate decisions for POST-SUBTASK-063, POST-SUBTASK-066, POST-SUBTASK-069.
- Epic-level integrated execution/review evidence demonstrating actual downstream consumption and safe failure behavior.
- A residual-risk/blocker disposition and maturity/evidence claim audit tied to exact artifact and runtime identities.

## End-to-end handoff

Exercise all child Story gates for Player, roster, recruiting, coaching, and matchup intelligence and prove the integrated capability is safe and consumable by its downstream Epic/release path.

## Stop instead of improvising when

- Stop before execution if any hard dependency, protected gate, source-rights decision, or target-resource precondition is unresolved.

## Completion protocol

1. Verify every required child issue is complete at its claimed maturity with verified evidence; do not infer completion from file or code existence.
2. Run or review the declared integrated end-to-end gate and downstream-consumption proof.
3. Create the aggregate evidence manifest with pinned source/data/code/config/model/runtime identities, residual blockers, accepted risks, null/negative results, and gate decisions.
4. Keep this Epic/Story non-READY and non-executable; route any implementation change to a specific atomic Subtask or create a controlled backlog proposal.
5. Update canonical/local Jira state and live Jira operational fields according to `jira/SYNC_CONTRACT.md` only after the aggregate gate is truthfully satisfied.
6. Rebuild all derivatives with `python -B jira/tools/rebuild_all_derivatives.py`, recompute queues, and run `python -B jira/tools/validate_second_pass.py`.
7. Reevaluate downstream gates without weakening protected requirements or hiding incomplete child evidence.
