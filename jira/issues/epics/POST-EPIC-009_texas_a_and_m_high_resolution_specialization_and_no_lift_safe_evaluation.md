}
```

## Objective

Build A&M-specific state and specialization candidates while requiring protected evidence and accepting a global-only/no-adjustment result.

## Why This Exists

The final W25 handoff identifies this capability as necessary to move from accepted design/functional starters to evidence-backed implementation, empirical validation, production readiness, or operation.

## Scope

All Stories and Subtasks under this Epic for the tamu domain, including its explicit integrated completion gate.

### Explicit In Scope

- Child implementation and evidence work
- Cross-domain hard dependencies
- Integrated end-to-end gate
- Preservation of source authority and protected controls

### Explicit Out of Scope

- Declaring child code sufficient without integrated evidence
- Changing protected requirements or ADRs without governance review
- Creating Wave 26

## Prerequisites

- Completion of POST-SUBTASK-063
- Completion of POST-SUBTASK-069
- Completion of POST-SUBTASK-078

## Hard Dependencies

- POST-SUBTASK-063
- POST-SUBTASK-069
- POST-SUBTASK-078

## Direct Requirements

- None.

## Direct Acceptance Controls

- None.

## Governance Traceability Inheritance

- Gate: `POST-SUBTASK-087`
- Inherited from: POST-SUBTASK-087
- Resolution: `INHERITED_DOMAIN_GATE`
- Effective counts: `{"acceptance_control_ids": 9, "adr_ids": 9, "gap_ids": 1, "requirement_ids": 42, "risk_ids": 7}`

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every child issue completes at its declared maturity and evidence state, or has an explicit accepted-risk/deferred disposition.
2. The Epic's end-to-end gate proves the integrated capability on the required real data, target host, protected chronology, or operating path; file existence alone is insufficient.
3. All requirement, acceptance-control, ADR, risk, gap, test, artifact, and source references remain valid and no protected invariant is weakened.

## Definition of Done

1. Every child Story POST-STORY-027, POST-STORY-028, POST-STORY-029 is completed through its explicit end-to-end gate or has an explicit accepted-risk/deferred/cancelled disposition consistent with release governance.
2. The Epic integrated capability is demonstrated on the required real data, chronology, target host, product path, or operating path; planning, code, fixtures, or unit tests alone cannot satisfy it.
3. All direct and inherited requirement/control/ADR/risk/gap mappings resolve, all release-blocking controls have current evidence, and no protected invariant is weakened.
4. The Epic evidence manifest pins all relevant source/data/code/config/model/calibrator/split/cutoff/runtime/hardware identities and preserves failures, null results, and unresolved limitations.
5. Canonical/derived Jira views, live operational fields when connected, links, queues, release gates, and downstream states are synchronized and pass strict validation.

## Required Tests / Validation

- **END_TO_END** / `END_TO_END` — `POST-SUBTASK-081` — Story gate `POST-SUBTASK-081` must complete with verified evidence before Epic completion.
- **END_TO_END** / `END_TO_END` — `POST-SUBTASK-084` — Story gate `POST-SUBTASK-084` must complete with verified evidence before Epic completion.
- **END_TO_END** / `END_TO_END` — `POST-SUBTASK-087` — Story gate `POST-SUBTASK-087` must complete with verified evidence before Epic completion.
- **REPRODUCIBILITY** / `REPRODUCIBILITY` — `EPIC_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST` — Aggregate all Story gates, artifact identities, residual blockers, accepted risks, and downstream readiness.

## Required Evidence

- Verified Story gate decisions for POST-SUBTASK-081, POST-SUBTASK-084, POST-SUBTASK-087.
- Epic-level integrated execution/review evidence demonstrating actual downstream consumption and safe failure behavior.
- A residual-risk/blocker disposition and maturity/evidence claim audit tied to exact artifact and runtime identities.

## Completion Evidence Contract

```json
{
  "governance_traceability_gate": "POST-SUBTASK-087",
  "integrated_proof_required": true,
  "story_gates": [
    "POST-SUBTASK-081",
    "POST-SUBTASK-084",
    "POST-SUBTASK-087"
  ]
}
```

## End-to-End Validation Requirement

Exercise all child Story gates for Texas A&M high-resolution specialization and no-lift-safe evaluation and prove the integrated capability is safe and consumable by its downstream Epic/release path.

## Expected Maturity After Completion

`EMPIRICALLY_VALIDATED`

## Risk / Failure Conditions

- Children may appear complete while integration remains unproven
- Upstream data/rights/hardware evidence may remain unavailable

## Stop Conditions

- Stop before execution if any hard dependency, protected gate, source-rights decision, or target-resource precondition is unresolved.

## AI Context Notes

- Select child Subtasks from READY_QUEUE.csv; do not execute an Epic directly.
- Epic Done requires the final child gate and downstream-consumption evidence, not merely closed children.
